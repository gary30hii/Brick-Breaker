/**
 * The {@code brickGame.controller} package contains the controllers for the Brick Game application.
 * These controllers are responsible for handling user interactions and linking the user interface with the game model.
 *
 * This package includes classes that listen to user inputs, process these inputs, and then manipulate the game's state
 * or UI based on the game's rules and logic. The controllers work as an intermediary between the {@code brickGame.model}
 * package, which contains the game's data and rules, and the user interface, ensuring a responsive and interactive gaming experience.
 *
 * The primary focus of this package is to manage the flow of information between the game's front-end and back-end,
 * implementing the necessary game logic to react appropriately to user actions.
