/**
 * The {@code brickGame.model} package contains the core data models and business logic of the Brick Game application.
 * It includes classes that represent the various components and entities of the game, such as bricks, ball, paddle, score, and game state.
 * This package encapsulates the fundamental behavior of the game, independent of the user interface or game rendering mechanisms.
 *
 * The model classes are designed to be used by the game engine and controllers to manage the game's state and rules.
